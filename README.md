I have a degree in Civil Engineering and worked at Merrill Lynch investment bank for 4 years providing second line application support for traders in Fixed Income Currencies and Commodities section.  The role provided me the opportunity to use my `problem solving`, `communication` and `organisation` skills in a fast-moving dynamic setting.  This experience triggered my interest in software development, so I re-trained in software development by attending a boot camp with Makers and am very keen to apply my learning and further develop in the workplace.
